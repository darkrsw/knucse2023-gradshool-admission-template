# KNU CSE 2023 Grad School Admission Problem.

Write a program that dynamically generates a grid-based puzzle with variable start and exit points on each run. Places an autonomous agent within the puzzle that must
navigate to the exit. Employs a search algorithm (e.g., A*, Dijkstraâ€™s, BFS, DFS) for the agent to solve the puzzle.

### Requirements:
- The program should provide a visualization of the puzzle and the agent's movement from the start to the exit.
- Upon completion of each run, the program should output the steps taken by the agent, the path chosen, and the time and space complexity of the search.
- Document your choice of search algorithm and justify its appropriateness for this problem.
- Include error handling to manage instances where the puzzle is unsolvable.
- You can use any programming language but your program should be executable just after following the instructions you provided.
- Assume that the execution environment is a terminal on Ubuntu 22.04 without any GUI support.


### Deliverables:
- Source code of the program.
- A report documenting the design decisions, the search algorithm used, and the reasoning behind the choice of algorithm.
- A reflection on the challenges faced during the implementation and how they were overcome.
- (Optional) Suggestions for improving the agent's efficiency and reliability.
